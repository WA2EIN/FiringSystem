Add 5 Volt Regulator 7y805 in place of existing regulator.  Feed 3 Volt regulator from 5 volt source.  This increases the operating voltage range to +30 volts.

Add speed selection header to allow the PIC12F683 to operate at different serial speeds.

Relocate the RS-232 input so that it is conveniently placed when all three radios are installed.

Add power selection jumper to enable the Xtend and 9Xcite radios to operate from 5 Volts.
